Story Pitch:

We all know the importance of nutritious food to our health and longevity. Yet access to grocery stores differs profoundly across the country. Factors like race, income, and location all play a role. Many Americans live in food desert, or areas without easy access to grocery stores. They may find it more convenient to eat cheap, highly processed fast food, rather than fresh fruits and vegetables.
  
We also know that our health as children can often influence the trajectory of our lives. Eating and exercise habits instilled in us at a young age can often stick for life. Therefore, it’s critical to understand how children, in particular, are uniquely affected by food deserts.

Much work has already been done to improve food access for kids. One example is a comprehensive initiative called “Let’s Move!” orchestrated by the First Lady Michelle Obama. This initiative was aimed at “increasing physical activity and empowering parents and caregivers with the information and tools they need to make good choices for themselves and their families,” according to its official website. This initiative and these goals were started to help battle the rise in obesity for the current generation. This problem has been a big issue when looking at the overall health of America and especially the youth. The rates of obesity have exponentially risen and with the health disparities that people of color and disadvantaged experience, proper healthcare isn’t as attainable. This movement makes it so that those from all ages and all races are able to maintain a healthy lifestyle so that they can live a full life where they can pursue their dreams.
	
Given our interest in this area, we chose the following two datasets. The first, collected by the Department of Agriculture, covers access to grocery stores in every county in America for the years 2010 and 2015. The other, compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics, looks at demographics of public schools for every county, including racial diversity, student-teacher ratio, number of students who qualify for free or reduced lunch, etc. That dataset covers the years 2020-21. 
	
Since our first dataset spans multiple years, we’d like to analyze how food access changed between 2010 and 2015. Has access improved, deteriorated, or stayed about the same? Using our second dataset, we’d like to investigate whether the food access of a given county predicts the characteristics of its public schools. Are schools with more students of color likelier to be located in food deserts? If so, by how much? What about schools with more students who qualify for free or reduced lunch? If so, by how much? Our findings may raise questions about the efficacy of free or reduced lunch programs. After all, even if a student is guaranteed a meal at school, that doesn’t mean their meals at home are nutritious and filling.
  
Data shows that around 20% of American children are obese, and that childhood obesity has gotten worse over the past three decades. If we wish to combat this worrying trend, we need to understand its root causes, including food access. With a better understanding of the intersection of geography and food access, we can generate solutions tailored to each region of the country.

How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

Our first dataset was collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and covers food access across counties in the U.S. The excel spreadsheet contains many topic-specific tabs. Of these, we will only be using the “ACCESS” tab for our project.

Our second dataset was collected by the National Center for Education Statistics. It describes the demographic breakdown of public schools across counties in America.

How many observations (rows) are in your data?

The Food Environment Atlas dataset has 3219 rows. The Public School Characteristics dataset has 102,853 rows. 

How many features (columns) are in the data?

The Food Environment Atlas "ACCESS" dataset has 44 columns. The Public School 
Characteristics dataset has 78 columns. 

Background Research/Inspiration
1) Policy Map https://www.policymap.com/newmaps#/ : 
-This shares a common goal as our proposed project idea because it allows us to visually see where food insecurity and other food opportunities are lacking within our country via the “Health - Food Access” tab. 
-It ties directly with Chapter 15 of our textbook, which highlights the importance of data visualization.

2) Food Insecurity, Well-being, and Academic Success among College Students: Implications for Post COVID-19 Pandemic Programming https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/centers/cafshc/documents/food-insecurity-wellbeing-and-academic-success.pdf : 
-This PDF from the Ecology of Food and Nutrition journal analyzes the relationship between the food insecurity, well-being, and academic success of college students. 
-This shares a common interest with our proposed project because although the data is not being collected from public school students, college students still face similar food insecurity issues which can hinder their academic abilities.

3) Children Receiving Free or Reduced-Price School Lunch Have Higher Food Insufficiency Rates in Summer
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622088733?via%3Dihub: 
-This article mentions free or reduced-price school lunch and its importance in creating a sustainable and healthy environment within the school system for those of low income communities with limited access to healthy food options, or food access in general.   
-However, unlike our project, this paper focuses on food deprivation at the household level, rather than at the county level. The paper does not seem to mention food deserts.

4). School Meals are Essential for Student Health and Learning https://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/School-Meals-are-Essential-Health-and-Learning_FNL.pdf 
-This PDF addresses how school meal programs (federal school meal programs like the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program) play a significant role in issues of food insecurity, and health and wellness of children and/or students in low income families and communities. 
-Unlike our project, this article doesn’t address the issue of food deserts. 

5) Gauging the public health value of Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move' campaign
https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160823/NEWS/160829986/gauging-the-public-health-value-of-michelle-obama-s-let-s-move-campaign
-This article details a few of the 70 recommendations from the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity, one of which was to make the food served in public schools healthier. Like our project, this article is concerned with how to improve childhood health.
-Unlike our project, this article doesn’t mention food deserts, or the general geographic dimension of childhood obesity.
